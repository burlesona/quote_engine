"American communities require that new housing meet quality requirements that are very high by world or even Western European and Japanese standards. These requirements are designed by middle-class architects, planners, and citizens in conformity with what they believe is decent housing. But their concept of decency far surpasses what is necessary for human health and safety. Consequently, all new American dwellings are too costly for low-income people to occupy without direct subsidies. But subsidies are provided for only a few of the many households with incomes low enough to be eligible for them.

So there is a certain percentage of modern street frontage that will not deliver pedestrian quality. The only questions are: what percentage of your city must you give over to these uses and where do you locate them. What you need is a system of zoning based not on use, but on the quality of street frontage. Then develop your street grid with a rhythm of A streets and B streets. Designate those streets like your Walnut Street as A streets, where every building on these blocks must be high-grade, pedestrian-oriented and reinforce continuity... no parking lots, no curb cuts.

We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate-we can not consecrate-we can not hallow-this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us-that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion-that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain-that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom-and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.",Gettysburg Address,,Abraham,,Lincoln,,History

"..in general we call these sorts of claims [about why a road cannot be narrowed], by conventional thinkers (usually conventional, old-school, traffic engineers), technical brush-offs. The idea is that, through the misuse of their position, they simply blow off your legitimate design proposal with a technical brush-off. You are supposed to go away and not come back. The benefit to them is that they waste very little time on you and your proposal. However, you research the technical brush-off, find out that it is baloney, come back, and confront them. They then will say, Oh, good job, you're right. However, your idea won't work because ..... and they will give you another technical brush-off. This pattern can continue until either you give up or it is too late. Plus, a lot of damage can be done in the meantime by stirring up the neighbors, the fire chief, and/or the police. You have been given two technical brush-offs so far...The next brush-offs will likely have to do with the classification of the street and that they can't do what you propose. It might also be that they cannot use certain types of funding to reduce car-carrying capacity. By the time you get right down to the real issue, it will likely be that they simply do not want to do the road diet. It violates their paradigm.

If it resonates enough with other people that they say I must have this on my house, my shop, or my town (depending on the scale of the pattern) then they, too, build it and it becomes a local pattern. Later, if the people of the region see it and say we love this; we want to adopt it into our family of regional traditions, then it becomes a regional pattern.

Because if you're really wanting to engage the people (and the builders,) then they WILL learn a best architecture of their place, but they WILL NOT learn a half-dozen (or more) historical styles. Only architectural historians will do that. So if you really want to re-start a living tradition in a place, it cannot be based on a collection of historical styles, but rather on the simple notion of 'this is how we build here'.",,,Steve,,Mouzon,,Tradition

There is a third form, which is Shifted Transect Zone Bigotry. It's a quirky thing characterized by admiration of one zone, while living in an adjacent zone. The most common example is the millions of Americans who live in T-3 but lionize T-2. It's not Suburban Music, of course, it's Country Music.

And today, as you know, I am celebrated, I am rich. But when I am alone with myself, I have not the courage to think of myself as an artist in the great and ancient sense of the term. Giotto, Titian, Rembrandt were great painters.

"Is the whole of life visible to us, or isn't it rather that this side of death we see only one hemisphere? Painters--to take them alone--dead and buried, speak to the next generation or to several succeeding generations through their work. Is that all, or is there more to come? Perhaps death is not the hardest thing in a painter's life. For my own part, I declare I know nothing whatever about it, but looking at the stars always makes me dream, as simply as I dream over the black dots representing towns and villages on a map. Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of Xxxx? Just as we take the train to get to Yyyyyyy or Zzzzz, we take death to reach a star.",,,Vincent,,van Gogh,,Wisdom

"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and famous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that people won't feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in all of us. And when we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.",quoted by Nelson Mandela in his 1994 inauguration,,Maryanne,,Williamson,,Wisdom

"Has there ever been another place on earth where so many people of wealth and power have paid for and put up with so much architecture they detested? I doubt it seriously. Every child goes to school in a building that looks like a duplicating-machine replacement-parts wholesale distribution warehouse. Not even the school board, who commissioned it and approved the plans, can figure it out. The main thing is to try to avoid having to explain it to the parents.",From Bauhaus to Our House,,Tom,,Wolfe,,Modernism
"What we must know in organic architecture is not found in books. It is necessary to have recourse to Nature with a capital N in order to get an education. Necessary to learn from trees, flowers, shells -- objects which contain truths of form following function.* If we stopped there, then it would be mererly imitation. But if we dig deep enough... we arrive at secrets of form related to purpose that will make of the tree a building, and the building a tree.",,,Frank,Lloyd,Wright,,Architecture
